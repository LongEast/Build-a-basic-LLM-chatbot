Nice tutorial: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/llms/build-conversational-apps

To start with, you need to download `Streamlit`, and also make it sure that you have downloaded `pip`.

Then run this command under your working directory.
```pip  install streamlit```

After that, you can run the code by
```steamlit run app.py```
Notice that `app.py` is the name of the program.
